## Navigating the Bottleneck: Realigning HR Recognition and Performance Evaluation with the Theory of Constraints

**A fundamental conflict exists between traditional HR performance metrics and the holistic approach of the Theory of Constraints (TOC), creating a significant bottleneck to organizational success. To truly leverage TOC, companies must shift their focus from optimizing individual performance to celebrating and rewarding contributions to the overall system's throughput.** Standard performance evaluations and recognition programs, with their emphasis on individual efficiency and localized metrics, often inadvertently incentivize behaviors that harm the system's overall performance. Eliyahu Goldratt, the creator of TOC, aptly summarized this dilemma: "Tell me how you measure me, and I will tell you how I will behave." If we continue to measure and reward employees based on individual output, we will perpetuate a culture of localized optimization at the expense of the global goal.

My perspective is that HR departments have a critical role to play in a successful TOC implementation. By redesigning recognition and performance evaluation systems to align with TOC principles, HR can transform from a potential policy constraint into a powerful driver of system-wide improvement. This requires a paradigm shift, moving away from the familiar comfort of individual metrics and embracing a more nuanced, system-aware approach.

Here are four key arguments for realigning HR recognition and performance evaluation with the Theory of Constraints:

### 1. Individual Efficiency is a Flawed Metric; Focus on Constraint Contribution.

Traditional performance management systems are built on the assumption that if everyone performs their individual tasks as efficiently as possible, the entire organization will be successful. The Theory of Constraints dismantles this assumption, demonstrating that optimizing a non-bottleneck resource does not improve the system's overall output and can, in fact, be detrimental. An hour saved at a non-bottleneck is a "mirage," as Goldratt stated, because it doesn't translate to an increase in throughput for the entire system.

Performance evaluations should therefore de-emphasize metrics of individual efficiency for those not working on the constraint. Instead, they should focus on behaviors that support the constraint's performance. For non-constraint roles, key performance indicators (KPIs) should center on:

*   **Subordination:** How well did the employee or team subordinate their work to the needs of the constraint? This includes ensuring the constraint is never starved for work and that work is not piled up in front of it, creating excess inventory.
*   **Flexibility and Support:** Did the employee demonstrate a willingness and ability to assist the constraint, even if it meant temporarily deviating from their primary tasks?
*   **Process Improvement:** Did the employee contribute ideas or actions that improved the flow of work towards and away from the constraint?

For those working directly on the constraint, the focus should be on maximizing its uptime and output. Their performance should be measured by the throughput of the entire system, not just their individual productivity.

**Counterpoint:** Critics might argue that abandoning individual efficiency metrics will lead to a decline in accountability and productivity among non-constraint employees. This can be mitigated by clearly communicating the TOC philosophy and demonstrating how individual contributions to the system's flow are valued and rewarded. The goal is not to encourage slacking but to redirect effort towards what truly matters for the organization's success.

### 2. Team-Based Recognition is Paramount.

Since the performance of the entire system is dependent on the effective management of the constraint, recognition and rewards should be heavily weighted towards team and system-level achievements. Rewarding individuals for hitting personal targets can create silos and internal competition that undermine the collaborative spirit necessary for TOC to succeed.

HR should design recognition programs that celebrate:

*   **Successful Constraint Elevation:** When a team successfully identifies and elevates a constraint, leading to a measurable increase in throughput, this should be a major cause for celebration and reward.
*   **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Acknowledge and reward teams that demonstrate exceptional collaboration in subordinating their activities to the needs of the constraint. This reinforces the idea that the "weakest link is the strength of the chain."
*   **System-Wide Achievements:** Link bonuses and other significant rewards to the overall performance of the system—namely, increases in throughput, reductions in inventory, and decreases in operating expenses.

**Counterpoint:** A potential drawback of team-based rewards is the "free-rider" problem, where some individuals may not contribute as much as others. This can be addressed through peer feedback mechanisms within the team and by ensuring that managers are actively involved in observing and coaching team dynamics. The focus should be on the team's collective success, but individual contributions to that success can still be qualitatively assessed.

### 3. Performance Evaluations Must Evolve into Collaborative, System-Focused Conversations.

The annual performance review, often a backward-looking and anxiety-inducing process, is particularly ill-suited for a TOC environment. Instead, performance management should be a continuous, forward-looking conversation focused on improving the system.

These conversations should be structured around:

*   **Understanding the System:** Is the employee aware of the current system constraint? Do they understand how their role impacts it?
*   **Problem-Solving:** What obstacles are preventing a smoother flow of work? How can the employee, their team, and management work together to address these issues?
*   **Skill Development:** What new skills or knowledge would enable the employee to better support the constraint or contribute to elevating it?

This approach shifts the manager's role from a judge to a coach and facilitator, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and psychological safety.

**Counterpoint:** Some may argue that this "softer" approach to performance management lacks the rigor of traditional, data-driven evaluations. However, a TOC-aligned system is intensely data-driven, just with different data. The focus shifts from individual output data to data about the flow of work, the performance of the constraint, and the overall throughput of the system. These conversations are grounded in the reality of the system's performance.

### 4. Overcoming Resistance Requires Strong Leadership and Clear Communication.

Implementing such a radical shift in performance management will inevitably face resistance. Employees accustomed to being judged on individual metrics may feel a loss of control or a lack of recognition for their personal efforts.

To overcome this, leadership and HR must:

*   **Provide Comprehensive Training:** All employees need to be educated on the principles of TOC. They need to understand *why* the old way of measuring performance is being replaced.
*   **Lead by Example:** Senior leadership must champion the new approach and be evaluated by the same system-level metrics.
*   **Communicate Successes:** When the new approach leads to improved system performance, these successes must be widely communicated and celebrated. This demonstrates the value of the new methodology and builds momentum for change.

By proactively managing this change, organizations can mitigate the fear and uncertainty that often accompany such a significant cultural shift.

In conclusion, for the Theory of Constraints to deliver on its promise of ongoing improvement, it cannot be confined to the operations department. It must be woven into the very fabric of the organization, and that includes the systems that evaluate and recognize its people. By moving away from an outdated focus on individual efficiency and embracing a system-level perspective, HR can play a pivotal role in unleashing the full potential of the organization.

Agent: DebateAgent_1
--------------------
Excellent points, DebateAgent_0. Your argument for a radical overhaul of HR systems to align with the Theory of Constraints is both compelling and ideologically pure. The vision of an entire organization seamlessly subordinating to the constraint is the ideal state of a TOC implementation.

However, from my perspective as a practitioner who has seen elegant theories crumble against the messy reality of human behavior and organizational inertia, I must introduce a strong note of caution. While your diagnosis of the problem is accurate—traditional HR metrics can indeed create a policy constraint—your proposed cure risks throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

Swinging the pendulum entirely from individual optimization to system-level contribution is a dangerous overcorrection. A more robust and sustainable approach is not to *replace* individual accountability with system metrics, but to create a sophisticated *integration* of the two.

Here are my key arguments for a more balanced, pragmatic approach:

### 1. The Erosion of Accountability: The "Free-Rider" Problem is a System-Killer.

While you correctly identify the flaw in optimizing non-constraints, your solution—to de-emphasize individual efficiency metrics—opens a Pandora's box of performance issues. The idea that all non-constraint employees will be motivated solely by their contribution to the system is overly optimistic. In any complex organization, a significant portion of the workforce is not directly adjacent to the constraint; their connection to it is abstract. Removing individual performance standards for these roles creates a vacuum where mediocrity can flourish.

If an employee in accounting, marketing, or R&D is told their only measure of success is "supporting the constraint," without clear, individual, and measurable goals, you invite widespread social loafing. Accountability becomes so diffuse that it belongs to everyone and thus, to no one. The "free-rider" problem you mention as a minor counterpoint is, in my experience, a primary obstacle that can cripple teams and poison morale far more effectively than misaligned KPIs. A hybrid model is essential: reward system-level success with bonuses, but maintain clear individual performance standards for core job duties, ensuring everyone is pulling their own weight.

**Anticipated Counterpoint:** You would argue that the system's throughput is the only metric that matters. I would respond that a system composed of underperforming individuals will inevitably degrade. Its capacity will shrink, and the constraint will eventually shift to a department crippled by a lack of individual accountability.

### 2. The Moving Constraint: Building an HR System on Shifting Sands is Unfeasible.

A successful TOC implementation is dynamic. The goal is to identify a constraint, subordinate, elevate it... and then find the *next* one. Constraints are not static; they are meant to move. Your proposal seems to premise an HR system built around a single, stable constraint.

Imagine the operational chaos: This quarter, the constraint is the welding machine, so we design all performance reviews around supporting the welders. Next quarter, we elevate that constraint, and the bottleneck shifts to the quality assurance team. Do we then frantically redesign everyone's KPIs again? This creates instability, confusion, and "flavor-of-the-month" fatigue among employees. HR systems, particularly those tied to compensation and career progression, require a degree of stability to be perceived as fair and trustworthy. The focus should be less on rewarding contribution to the *current* constraint and more on rewarding the *enduring behaviors* that support TOC in general: flexibility, rapid problem-solving, cross-functional communication, and a proactive mindset toward improvement.

**Anticipated Counterpoint:** You might say that this dynamism is precisely the point and the organization must be agile. I contend that while operational agility is key, HR and compensation systems must be the stable bedrock upon which that agility is built, not a constantly moving target that exhausts and confuses the very people you need to be flexible.

### 3. Human Motivation is Nuanced: High Performers Need Individual Recognition.

Your emphasis on team-based recognition correctly identifies collaboration as a cornerstone of TOC. However, it dangerously ignores the psychological need for individual recognition. Your top performers—the "A-players" who consistently go above and beyond—are often driven by a desire for personal acknowledgment and a sense of individual achievement.

If their exceptional efforts are consistently subsumed into a team-level or system-level reward, you create a powerful disincentive. They will rightly ask, "Why should I work 20% harder than everyone else if we all get the same recognition?" This isn't selfishness; it's human nature. Over time, this approach doesn't lift the team average; it pushes your best performers to regress to the mean or, worse, leave the organization for a place where their individual contributions are seen and valued. The solution is not either/or. Celebrate team wins loudly, but also create specific, prestigious individual awards for "Constraint Busters" or "Flow Champions"—people who exemplified the right behaviors, regardless of their position relative to the bottleneck.

In conclusion, the spirit of your argument is correct—HR must evolve. But this evolution should be a sophisticated fusion, not a revolution that discards decades of understanding about individual accountability and motivation. We need a balanced scorecard where system throughput is the ultimate goal, but it is supported by clear individual expectations, stable performance frameworks, and a recognition system that acknowledges both the team and the exceptional individuals who drive its success.

Agent: DebateAgent_2
--------------------
Excellent arguments from my colleagues. DebateAgent_0 has laid out a powerful, pure vision for a Theory of Constraints (TOC) driven organization, while DebateAgent_1 has grounded the conversation in the pragmatic realities of human motivation and organizational stability. Both perspectives illuminate a core tension, but they share a common flaw: they treat performance management as a static system for judging past results.

My perspective is that this entire framework is outdated. The purpose of an HR and recognition system in a TOC environment is not to be a scorecard, but a **guidance system**. Its primary function should be to build the organization's *capability* for continuous improvement. We are debating the design of the speedometer and the fuel gauge, when we should be focusing on upgrading the engine and training the driver.

Therefore, we must shift the focus from *retrospective evaluation* to *prospective capability-building*. It’s not about choosing between individual and system metrics; it’s about designing a system that uses measurement to make the organization smarter, faster, and more adaptive.

Here are my key arguments:

### 1. Performance Reviews Must Become System Diagnostics.

Both of my colleagues’ proposals still frame performance evaluation as a tool to rate the employee. I propose we use it to diagnose the *system*. When a target is missed—whether individual or team-based—the primary question in a review should not be "Who is to blame?" but "**Why did the system produce this result?**"

An individual's failure to keep up is not necessarily a personal failing; it may be a symptom of poor training, flawed inputs from an upstream process, or a previously unidentified policy constraint. A manager’s role in a review is not to be a judge, but a lead investigator, working with the employee to map the process and identify the systemic friction points. Accountability then shifts from "hitting your numbers" to "actively and honestly participating in improving the system." This transforms the review from a dreaded judgment day into a vital, collaborative problem-solving session that strengthens the entire organization.

**Anticipated Counterpoint:** Critics will claim this approach creates a "no-fault" culture that erodes accountability. On the contrary, it creates a "right-fault" culture. It moves beyond blaming the nearest person—the easiest and least effective solution—to pinpointing and fixing the root systemic cause. This fosters a far deeper level of accountability and psychological safety, encouraging people to flag problems early rather than hide them.

### 2. We Must Measure and Reward "Constraint-Agnostic" Competencies.

DebateAgent_1 rightly warns that building an HR system around a constantly moving constraint is chaotic. The solution is not to default back to generic individual metrics, but to define, teach, and reward the underlying *skills* that allow the organization to manage *any* constraint, wherever it may arise. Performance evaluations and career progression should be explicitly tied to an employee's demonstrated mastery of these core competencies:

*   **Systems Thinking:** Can the employee articulate how their work impacts upstream and downstream processes?
*   **Logical Root Cause Analysis:** Do they move beyond symptoms to identify the core problem driving undesirable effects?
*   **Rapid Experimentation:** Are they actively using small, fast cycles of Plan-Do-Check-Act to test improvements?
*   **Cross-Functional Communication:** How effectively do they communicate data and needs to other departments to ensure smooth flow?

By developing and rewarding these skills, you are future-proofing your organization. You are building an army of problem-solvers who can adapt and thrive as the bottleneck shifts, which is the entire point of TOC.

### 3. Differentiate HR Policies Based on Proximity to the Constraint.

A one-size-fits-all HR system is a critical error. The way we measure and recognize an employee should depend entirely on their role relative to the system's constraint. I propose a tiered approach:

*   **Tier 1 (The Constraint and its direct support):** For these roles, performance is almost exclusively tied to system throughput, uptime, and flow. Individual metrics are irrelevant unless they directly contribute to those system outcomes. This is where DebateAgent_0's pure vision applies perfectly.
*   **Tier 2 (Indirect Support - e.g., HR, Purchasing):** Here, a hybrid model is necessary. These functions need clear individual goals for their core tasks, but they must *also* be measured on specific KPIs related to serving Tier 1. For example, HR's "time-to-hire" for a constraint-area position is a critical performance metric.
*   **Tier 3 (Long-Range Functions - e.g., R&D, Strategy):** Measuring these teams on today's throughput is nonsensical. Their performance should be judged on their success in identifying and mitigating *future* constraints and developing new capabilities that will elevate the entire system's performance ceiling in the long term.

This differentiated approach is more complex, but it is also far more effective and fair because it aligns measurement with an employee's actual ability to influence the system's success.

In conclusion, let's stop treating our people as cogs to be measured and start seeing them as the system's adaptable brain. By redesigning our HR systems to be diagnostic, capability-focused, and context-aware, we move beyond the limiting debate of individual versus team. We create a learning organization that doesn't just manage constraints—it systematically masters them.

Agent: DebateAgent_3
--------------------
Excellent debate. My colleagues have explored the philosophical purity of a TOC-driven HR system, the pragmatic need for individual accountability, and the forward-looking approach of building organizational capability. Each view is compelling, but they all share a critical flaw: they get lost in measuring proxies for success, creating complex systems of competencies, tiered KPIs, and behavioral goals.

They are debating the intricate design of a car's dashboard while forgetting the car's only purpose: to get to a destination. The destination for any organization, as defined by the Theory of Constraints, is simple: **to make more money now and in the future.**

My perspective is that we must ruthlessly simplify. The entire HR recognition and performance evaluation system must be anchored directly and explicitly to TOC's global financial metrics: **Throughput (T), Inventory/Investment (I), and Operating Expense (OE).** We must stop rewarding behaviors and start rewarding quantifiable financial outcomes. This isn't a "cold" approach; it is the most honest and powerful way to align every single employee with the ultimate goal.

Here are my key arguments:

### 1. Throughput Accounting is the Only Scorecard that Matters.

We are overcomplicating the measurement of performance. The elegant simplicity of TOC is that it boils all of an organization's complex activities down to three numbers. An action is good if it increases Throughput, decreases Inventory, or decreases Operating Expense. An action is bad if it does the opposite. Our performance systems should be just as simple.

Instead of debating the merits of rewarding "systems thinking" or "constraint support," we should ask a more powerful question: **"How did this team's actions this quarter affect T, I, and OE?"**

*   **Recognition & Bonuses:** Don't tie bonuses to individual efficiency or team collaboration. Tie them to a measurable improvement in the **Throughput Dollar Days (TDD)** of inventory or a direct increase in the system's overall Throughput.
*   **Performance Evaluation:** A performance review becomes a financial impact review. An employee at a non-constraint who "looks busy" by overproducing parts is having a negative performance review, because they increased Inventory (a liability) with no impact on Throughput. An employee who fixes a nagging quality issue upstream, preventing two hours of rework at the constraint, is a top performer because they directly protected and increased Throughput.

This strips away ambiguity and office politics. The numbers tell the story.

**Anticipated Counterpoint:** My colleagues would argue that this is a lagging indicator and doesn't measure the forward-looking "capabilities" needed for success. I argue it's the only indicator that isn't a vanity metric. Capabilities are only valuable if they translate into financial results. By making T, I, and OE the focus, you force the development of the *right* capabilities—the ones that actually make the company more money.

### 2. Every HR Initiative is an Investment to be Judged by its Financial Return.

DebateAgent_2 correctly positions performance reviews as "system diagnostics," but let's take that logic to its conclusion. The HR department and its systems are part of the system's Operating Expense. Therefore, every dollar spent on performance management, recognition programs, and training must be justified by its return in terms of T and I.

*   A proposed training program (an increase in OE) is not approved because it teaches "good skills." It is approved because we can build a logical case, using the TOC thinking processes, that it will break a constraint and generate a tenfold return in new Throughput.
*   The annual performance review cycle (a massive drain on OE via manager and employee time) should be rigorously questioned. Does this multi-million dollar expense actually increase T? Or could a simpler, buffer-management-based feedback system achieve better results at a fraction of the cost?

This elevates HR from a "soft" support function to a hard-nosed driver of profitability. It forces HR to think like the COO, making strategic investments in people and processes that have a clear, predictable financial payoff.

### 3. This Framework Solves the "Local vs. Global" and "Individual vs. Team" Dilemmas.

The financial lens elegantly resolves the core conflicts raised by my colleagues. The problem with traditional metrics is not just that they are "local," but that they use the wrong financial logic (cost accounting). Throughput Accounting provides a universal language for judging all actions.

*   **Individual Accountability:** An individual is held accountable for the *financial consequences* of their actions on the global system. This is far more meaningful than hitting a local efficiency target. It empowers employees by giving them a direct line of sight between their work and the company's bottom line.
*   **Team Recognition:** A team's success is not measured by how well they collaborated. It's measured by the bottom-line impact of their project. Did their cross-functional project to reduce batch sizes cut inventory holding costs (I) and improve lead times, thereby increasing Throughput (T)? If so, they are rewarded.

This approach aligns everyone. The marketing department isn't judged on the number of leads generated (a local metric that can increase OE) but on its contribution to generating high-Throughput sales. The R&D department is judged on its ability to design products that can be produced with minimal disruption to the existing constraint, protecting system Throughput.

In conclusion, let's stop trying to engineer the perfect behavioral modification system. That path leads to complexity, confusion, and subjectivity. The true path to alignment is to embrace the ruthless simplicity at the heart of the Theory of Constraints. Make Throughput, Inventory, and Operating Expense the language of performance. Measure everyone by their impact on these three numbers, and the right behaviors and capabilities will inevitably follow.

**Title:** Committee Report: Aligning HR Systems with the Theory of Constraints (TOC)

**Summary of Current Challenge and Historical Context**

Management has initiated a review of the organization's Human Resources (HR) recognition and performance evaluation systems to ensure they align with and support our implementation of the Theory of Constraints (TOC).

Historically, our performance management framework has been rooted in traditional cost-accounting principles, emphasizing individual efficiency and optimization of local departmental metrics. This has inadvertently created a "policy constraint," where the very systems designed to motivate employees may encourage behaviors detrimental to the overall system's goal. As Eliyahu Goldratt stated, "Tell me how you measure me, and I will tell you how I will behave." Rewarding localized efficiency often leads to overproduction, excess inventory, and a lack of focus on the true bottleneck, ultimately hindering the organization's primary objective: to increase throughput.

The current challenge is to transform our HR systems from a potential obstacle into a powerful engine for driving system-wide improvement, ensuring every employee is measured and rewarded based on their contribution to the global success of the organization.

**Key Agreements and Disagreements**

The committee's expert agents reached a strong consensus on several foundational points:

*   **The Status Quo is Untenable:** All agree that traditional, siloed performance metrics are fundamentally incompatible with TOC and must be reformed.
*   **Shift from Local to Global:** The core objective of any new system must be to shift focus from local efficiencies to global system performance.
*   **HR's Strategic Role:** HR must evolve from a support function to a strategic partner in implementing TOC.

However, significant debate emerged regarding the best methodology for achieving this alignment, highlighting several key tensions:

1.  **What to Measure? The Core of the Debate:**
    *   **Behaviors:** One view advocated for measuring behaviors that support the constraint, such as subordination and cross-functional collaboration.
    *   **Capabilities:** Another perspective proposed measuring and rewarding enduring, "constraint-agnostic" competencies like systems thinking and root cause analysis.
    *   **Hybrid Duties:** A pragmatic view stressed the need to balance system-support goals with clear individual performance standards to maintain accountability.
    *   **Financial Outcomes:** A final view argued for ruthless simplicity, anchoring all measurement directly to TOC's global financial metrics: Throughput (T), Inventory (I), and Operating Expense (OE).

2.  **Individual vs. System Accountability:** There was disagreement on how to balance individual accountability against team or system-wide success. Concerns were raised that a purely system-focused approach could encourage "free-riding" and demotivate top performers, while a purely individual approach perpetuates the current problem.

3.  **Stability vs. Agility:** A major point of contention was how to build a stable, fair HR system around a constraint that, in a successful TOC implementation, is designed to move. A system tied too closely to the *current* constraint risks becoming chaotic and fatiguing for employees.

**Updated Recommendations**

After synthesizing the expert viewpoints, the committee proposes a multi-layered framework that leverages the strengths of each perspective. We recommend moving away from a single, one-size-fits-all system to a differentiated approach anchored in a clear financial philosophy.

1.  **Adopt Throughput Accounting as the Guiding Philosophy:** The ultimate measure of the organization's success is its ability to make more money. Therefore, the impact on **Throughput (T), Inventory (I), and Operating Expense (OE)** should serve as the universal language and final arbiter for evaluating all major initiatives, team projects, and HR investments.

2.  **Implement a Differentiated, Tiered Performance System:** Recognize that not all roles have the same proximity or impact on the constraint. We recommend structuring performance management into three tiers:
    *   **Tier 1 (The Constraint):** For employees working directly on or in immediate support of the system's constraint, performance should be almost exclusively tied to system-level outcomes: constraint uptime, buffer stability, and overall system Throughput. Team-based recognition is paramount here.
    *   **Tier 2 (Indirect Support):** For functions like HR, finance, and purchasing, a hybrid model is necessary. It should include (a) clear goals for core individual responsibilities and (b) critical KPIs directly linked to serving Tier 1 (e.g., HR's "time-to-hire" for a constraint position; Purchasing's on-time delivery of critical materials).
    *   **Tier 3 (Long-Range Functions):** For departments like R&D or long-term strategy, judging performance on today's throughput is counterproductive. Their metrics should be based on developing future capabilities and innovations that will elevate the system's performance ceiling in the long term, effectively mitigating *future* constraints.

3.  **Transform Performance Conversations into System Diagnostics:** Shift the purpose of performance reviews from a retrospective rating of the individual to a collaborative, forward-looking diagnosis of the system. The primary question should change from "Did you hit your numbers?" to "**Why did the system produce this result?**" This fosters a culture of continuous improvement, psychological safety, and shared accountability for fixing systemic issues.

4.  **Develop and Reward "Constraint-Agnostic" Competencies:** To ensure organizational agility as constraints shift, HR should identify, train for, and formally recognize core competencies essential for a TOC environment. These include Systems Thinking, Logical Root Cause Analysis, and effective Cross-Functional Communication. This builds a stable foundation of capability that serves the organization regardless of where the bottleneck is located.

5.  **Launch a Comprehensive Communication and Training Initiative:** No change of this magnitude can succeed without buy-in. Leadership must champion this new framework by providing robust training on TOC principles and Throughput Accounting for all employees. Early successes under the new model must be widely communicated and celebrated to build momentum and reinforce the value of a systems-thinking approach.

**Notable Changes from Previous Reports**

This is the inaugural committee report on this subject. It establishes a new strategic direction for aligning our human capital strategy with the core operational principles of the Theory of Constraints. Future reports will measure progress against these foundational recommendations.
